# setjap
Commandline utility

Used to change the boot region (this is not a display fix) of PSX GAME to NTSC/J. This comes in handy for some of the old japanese PSone with mod chip installs that only let you boot backup games that have your region boot code in them.

Usage: "this utility" "option" "target file"

Options: 
  --jp - convert boot region to NTSC/J
  --us - convert boot region to NTSC/U
  --eu - convert boot region to PAL

Default option (if no option specified): --jp
